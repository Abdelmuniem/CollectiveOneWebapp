1	2016-09-04 12:55:13.786	This is a general tag that is useful to group the activity related to the conceptual analysis of CoProjects	1	1	71
2	2016-09-05 16:03:11.799	He makes a lot of english typos	1	1	105
3	2016-09-05 16:03:27.427	He dont have time now	1	1	105
4	2016-09-10 11:31:57.543	The idea is that goals are hierarchical, so that any goal can be decomposed in any number of subgoals an indefinite number of times.	1	1	146
5	2016-09-10 11:32:31.597	The set of goals should tend to become the "technical specification' of the project.	1	1	146
6	2016-09-10 11:33:38.624	The name "milestones" suggests that they are long term and have similar detail level among them	1	1	146
7	2016-09-10 11:33:57.028	The name goals is weird	0	1	146
8	2016-10-06 16:44:28.198	Its very uncomfortable to not having the option of opening in a new tab. This is really needed	0	1	182
9	2016-10-06 16:45:41.378	Actually ANCHORS have other associated problems. They should be changed to Buttons.	1	7	182
10	2016-10-06 16:47:38.102	Search engines bots wont be able to understand the page structure if we dont change this divs for anchors or buttons	0	4	182
11	2016-10-13 14:33:14.543	The current prototype should be enough to be used to further develop both the CollectiveOne concept and the web application, as long as 1) it is used in combination of other tools, like Slack and GitHub, 2) there is good will in those getting involved, and 3) the number of people involved is not excessive. 	0	1	232
12	2016-10-14 10:24:00.244	This step is aligned with the concepts of openness and soft ownership promoted by CollectiveOne	0	1	232
14	2016-10-14 10:41:25.233	Allowing others (not the in-kind contributors) to absorb the risk of project failure out of the in-kind contributors could make attracting in-kind contributors easier. 	0	1	233
15	2016-10-14 10:47:49.775	Having the *option* of contributing with money instead of in-kind contributors does not means forbidding in-kind contributions in exchange of participation points. Perhaps both can coexist. 	0	1	233
16	2016-10-14 18:52:56.472	Perhaps the kickstarter campaign is not incompatible with promoting CollectiveOne in Reddit and slack channels. With the kickstarter campaign people interested can opt between putting money or directly contributing, and contributors can decide if getting paid in money or in participation points. 	0	1	233
17	2016-10-14 18:56:24.27	Preparing a successful kickstarter campaign requires a lot of effort and probably some investment (video, logo... ).	1	1	233
18	2016-10-14 19:09:24.682	Getting more people inside before key open points have been solved (e.g. the business model) might complicate things too much 	1	1	232
13	2016-10-14 10:34:02.266	Paying for contributions is not fully inline with the method proposed by CollectiveOne: that retributing contributors with participation points is enough. 	1	1	233
19	2016-10-18 08:37:02.348	The fastest the CollectiveOne method is tested, the sooner we will know if it makes sense, and we will have hints on how to improve it.	0	1	232
20	2016-10-18 08:45:09.472	Previous experiences of other collaborative open projects platforms like Bettermeans, Assembly and, now, Collaborizm and Colony, suggest that the standard company approach (founder-investor-workers) may not be the most adequate for this kind of projects. Once we have investors on-board, they will probably constrain the path ahead by pushing for a less-open path. 	1	1	233
21	2016-10-19 13:57:56.728	The ‘kickstarter’ approach does require lots of prep time. But we must assess how that time compares with the competing alternatives. Funding the project directly (i.e. hiring someone with our money to do the job) probably requires the same amount of time, but locks out valuable feedback . Opening the platform to contributions from anyone requires us to potentially vote on MANY proposals/decisions from people who lack sufficient information to propose meaningful contributions.  I would imagine having to vote down hundreds of proposals before someone actually gets a concrete meaningful contribution assigned. See my arguments to the related decision https://collectiveone.herokuapp.com/views/DecisionPage.action?decisionId=232	0	3	233
22	2016-10-19 14:04:13.999	I think that opening the project completely (prototype and concept) implies risks and potentially lots of wasted time. Risks come from allowing the project to diverge too quickly from what we *would* want it to be (the issue here is that there is not enough structure for our arguments and model to show full potential).  Wasted time is a concern, to the extent that the current state of the project is insufficient to allow concrete meaningful contributions. We would spend lots of time explaining ourselves.  	1	3	232
23	2016-10-19 14:10:03.678	I think we could try to open up the model (at the same time that we launch a kickstarter campaign), but without inviting point contributions (and without opening the prototype). This could be done along the lines of what @pepospina is already doing here: https://medium.com/@pepoospina/labor-only-tokens-for-decentralized-autonomous-companies-c2e62a653a41#.seecbrf3q \n\nThe reason for doing this instead of what the decision item suggests, is that we can be more selective  in the way we allocate our time and resources (e.g. ignore people who just ask millions of questions). See my other comment below about fears of 'uncontrolled' demands for our time.	1	3	232
24	2016-10-19 14:12:45.913	Milestones imply a fixed time horizon. In some projects there will be goals (those high up in the hierarchy) that are likely never reached – and that's probably fine	1	3	146
25	2016-10-19 21:18:04.372	Graph databases are awesome	0	5	267

3	yes!	2016-09-27 17:40:57.131	0	63	1	2
4	A dummy version of the welcome page is already there but should be improved	2016-09-28 15:59:26.363	0	59	1	\N
5	After making an update of goals, now I think that perhaps we should try to stick with the single goal per contribution approach. Since goal have parent goals, it can be assumed that a contribution applies to its goal, and also to all its parents. Users can then discuss and agree on the goals structure, rather than on the assigning multiple goals to one contribution 	2016-10-03 14:51:02.765	0	40	1	\N
6	Perhaps we should keep this contribution limited to a first draft that clearly conveys the message and shows the key features of the application and use other contributions to improve it, and eventually convert it into a welcome video	2016-10-06 17:16:33.338	0	68	1	\N
7	This is a significant (and quite fundamental) contribution by @estenanortizospina, however I suggest we consider it closed once it has been tested to include non-homogeneous pps distributions, and when a time bound mechanism, similar to the one already in place, has been specified and tested in R.	2016-10-07 16:13:33.935	0	55	1	\N
